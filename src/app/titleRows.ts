Like Shizuku, Haru doesn’t have any friends thanks to his reputation, and it’s through their budding friendship — not to mention burgeoning romantic feelings — that the pair learns to understand one another, the world around them, and the tenor of their own emotions.",

Will the Taisho Baseball Girls be able to hit a home run, or will they strike out before they can even start?",

Since Kouichi’s been trying to build a relationship with Yuumi, the revelation that the cute new house guest is a non-related girl becomes a full blown disaster. Little girls grow up in unexpected ways as young love, teenage angst and a little higher education collide in KimiKiss Pure Rouge!",
